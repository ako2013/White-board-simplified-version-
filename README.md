# CS151-Final-Project

Things to Do Part A:

Instructions
For this part of the project we will all be working on the same GUI class separated into parts. It will be difficult to separate it evenly so we will all just have to pick parts and do it. For now let’s try to keep all the documentation in one place. Below we have a list of things that we need to do. Pick one at a time and write your name next to it if you are working on it. When you finish please write the API that you have  here (just a list of methods).

Warnings and notes
Please remember to read the directions for each part carefully on her website. Mason has already made a github so please remember to push changes to it xD (commit then sync). For the D. objects please make sure that you remember to use “Bean” class structures for x and y values (getters and setters).
